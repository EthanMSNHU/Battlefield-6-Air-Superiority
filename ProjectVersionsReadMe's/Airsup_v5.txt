Airsup_v5.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose

  - Adds dynamic score bars on top of v4 stable score architecture.

Major Functions And Why They Are Used

  - updateAllHudScores()
  Why: Becomes dual-purpose: updates score text and recalculates bar fill sizes each refresh. It is the key visual feedback function in this version.

  - createHUD(player)
  Why: Adds dedicated bar fill widgets (friendly/enemy) and stores names in PlayerHud for fast resize operations.

  - updateTeamScores()
  Why: Still owns when score changes happen; bars intentionally react only when score changes to avoid unnecessary UI churn.

  - getSecondsPerPoint(pointsHeld)
  Why: Preserves ticket pacing model, keeping gameplay balance consistent while visual fidelity increases.

Bar System Design

  - MAX_SCORE + MAX_BAR_WIDTH normalize bar growth.

  - Friendly side grows positive direction.

  - Enemy side uses mirrored growth (negative width) to keep center-aligned visual symmetry.

Why This Version Matters

  - Introduces an at-a-glance momentum indicator without changing scoring rules.

  - Demonstrates how visual systems can layer onto stable authoritative state.
