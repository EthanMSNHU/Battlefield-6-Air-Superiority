Airsup_v6.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose
- Most complete version: domination scoring + mirrored HUD + dynamic bars + live objective ownership states.

Main Changes Over v5
- PlayerHud map expanded with objective state widgets for A/B/C:
  - Neutral
  - Friendly
  - Enemy
- Adds objective visibility controller:
  - updateSingleObjectiveVisibility(...)
- Adds global objective refresh:
  - updateAllObjectiveIcons()

Core Runtime Loop
- Every second:
  - updateTeamScores()
  - updateAllObjectiveIcons()

Objective State Logic
- Each objective has three overlapping state widgets.
- All three are hidden, then one is shown based on:
  - objective owner
  - viewing player's team
- Neutral shown when owner is neither team 1 nor team 2.

Player Lifecycle
- On join: initializes stats, creates HUD, updates scores, updates objective icons.
- On capture: rewards players and refreshes objective icons.

Result
- Full player-relative HUD behavior for both scoring and objective control state.
