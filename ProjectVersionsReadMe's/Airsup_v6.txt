Airsup_v6.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose

  - Full-feature Air Sup HUD: mirrored scores, dynamic bars, and live objective ownership states.

Major Functions And Why They Are Used

  - OnGameModeStarted()
  Why: Complete mode bootstrap. It resets authoritative state, configures objectives, initializes scoreboard/HUD baseline, and runs continuous score + objective updates.

  - initializeAllCurrentPlayers()
  Why: Batch-initializes players already in match at mode start so no one misses HUD/stat setup.

  - initializePlayerState(player)
  Why: Single entry point for per-player stat reset + HUD creation. Reduces duplicate setup code across startup/join flows.

  - updateTeamScores()
  Why: Continues as scoring authority and triggers downstream UI updates only when necessary.

  - updateAllHudScores()
  Why: Updates player-relative text and bar visuals from authoritative score values.

  - updateSingleObjectiveVisibility(...)
  Why: Encapsulates objective-state decision logic for one objective stack (neutral/friendly/enemy), ensuring exactly one visual state is active.

  - updateAllObjectiveIcons()
  Why: Reads live ownership once per objective and applies visibility updates for all players, keeping objective indicators synchronized in real time.

  - OnCapturePointCaptured(capturePoint)
  Why: Awards capture rewards and immediately refreshes objective visuals after ownership changes.

Objective-State Design Rationale

  - Each objective uses overlapping widgets for neutral/friendly/enemy states.

  - Runtime toggles visibility instead of rebuilding widgets, which is cheaper and less error-prone.

  - Team-relative mapping ensures the same objective can appear friendly to one player and enemy to another.

Why This Version Matters

  - Represents the first complete gameplay + HUD readability package.

  - Combines stable authoritative scoring with player-perspective objective awareness.
