Airsup_v4.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose

  - Architectural stabilization pass for score synchronization and HUD updates.

Major Functions And Why They Are Used

  - OnGameModeStarted()
  Why: Resets both timers and authoritative score state at match start so no stale values leak between rounds.

  - updateTeamScores()
  Why: Main state mutator. It computes held objectives, advances timers, applies score updates, and gates expensive UI refresh work behind a score-changed check.

  - updateScoreBoardHeader()
  Why: Single function for header writes. This prevents inconsistent formatting and ensures both team headers come from the same source of truth.

  - updateAllHudScores()
  Why: Setter-based HUD refresh for every player. It maps global team scores into player-relative friendly/enemy display values.

  - createHUD(player)
  Why: Registers widget names in PlayerHud map so later updates can target existing widgets reliably.

Why gameState Is Important

  - It becomes the authoritative local score model.

  - Scoreboard header and HUD consume the same values, eliminating race/desync behavior from mixed read sources.

  - Future HUD features (bars/icons) can safely build on this foundation.

Why This Version Matters

  - First version where data flow is clearly authoritative and predictable.

  - Converts HUD behavior from ad-hoc rendering to controlled state mutation.
