Airsup_v4.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose
- Major architecture stabilization for HUD score updates.

Main Changes Over v3
- Adds authoritative team score object:
  - gameState.team1Score
  - gameState.team2Score
- Adds PlayerHud map keyed by player object ID to store widget names.
- Stops relying on widget recreation; updates existing widgets with setters.

Core Flow
- updateTeamScores mutates gameState + SetGameModeScore.
- On score change: updates scoreboard header + all HUD score labels.
- updateAllHudScores maps global team scores into player-relative friendly/enemy values.

Why It Matters
- Prevents stacked/duplicate UI behavior.
- Centralizes score truth for stable HUD/scoreboard sync.
