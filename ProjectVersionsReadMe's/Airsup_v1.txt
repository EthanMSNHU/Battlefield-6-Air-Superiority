Airsup_v1.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose

  - Baseline Air Superiority ruleset.

  - Establishes objective-based ticket flow and per-player custom scoreboard stats.

Major Functions And Why They Are Used

  - OnGameModeStarted()
  Why: This is the mode bootstrap and control loop. It configures capture points, initializes score, sets scoreboard layout, and runs the 1-second update cycle that keeps match logic alive.

  - setUpScoreBoard()
  Why: Centralizes scoreboard schema setup (type, columns, widths). Keeping this separate avoids repeating UI config and makes later versions easier to evolve.

  - updateScoreBoardTotal()
  Why: Syncs visible team header values with current game-mode scores so players always see accurate team ticket progress.

  - getSecondsPerPoint(pointsHeld)
  Why: Encodes pacing rules in one place (3->1s, 2->5s, 1->10s). This isolates balancing knobs so scoring speed can be tuned without touching core flow.

  - updateTeamScores()
  Why: Core scoring engine. It reads objective ownership, advances per-team timers, applies score increments at the correct cadence, and drives scoreboard freshness.

  - updatePlayerScoreBoard(player)
  Why: Single writer for player row values. This avoids stat desync by ensuring all events call one shared scoreboard update path.

  - OnPlayerEarnKill / OnPlayerDied / OnCapturePointCaptured
  Why: Event handlers that apply stat rewards/penalties at the moment gameplay events occur, then immediately refresh that player row.

System Design Notes

  - Team scoring uses elapsed-time timers per team instead of instant point bursts; this creates a steady domination feel.

  - Player stats are stored in fixed object-variable slots, which keeps writes lightweight and predictable.

  - This version is rules-first and intentionally simple before any HUD-heavy complexity.
