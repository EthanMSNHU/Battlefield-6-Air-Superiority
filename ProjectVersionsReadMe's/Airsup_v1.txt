Airsup_v1.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose
- Baseline domination-style Air Superiority logic.
- Handles capture-point scoring, team scoreboard headers, and player stat tracking.

Main Blocks
- Game state variables: player stat slots and team score timers.
- OnGameModeStarted: configures 3 capture points (100/101/102), initializes scoreboard, runs 1-second game loop.
- Scoreboard functions: set custom 2-team columns and update header scores.
- Team scoring: awards team score by objectives held (3->1s, 2->5s, 1->10s).
- Player events: join/kill/death/capture updates for scoreboard row stats.

Functions
- OnGameModeStarted(): mode setup + main loop.
- updateScoreBoardTotal(): updates header from current team scores.
- setUpScoreBoard(): sets scoreboard type/labels/widths.
- getSecondsPerPoint(pointsHeld): interval lookup by objectives held.
- updateTeamScores(): objective ownership count + timed score updates.
- OnPlayerJoinGame(player): initialize player stat vars.
- updatePlayerScoreBoard(player): writes score/kills/deaths/captures row values.
- OnPlayerEarnKill(player): +1 kill, +100 score.
- OnPlayerDied(player): +1 death.
- OnCapturePointCaptured(point): +1 capture, +200 score for players on owning team.
