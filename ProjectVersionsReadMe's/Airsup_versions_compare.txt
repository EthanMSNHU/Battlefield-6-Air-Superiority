Airsup Version Comparison (v1 -> v7)
===================================

Purpose Of This Comparison

  - Show how Air Sup evolved from a rules-only prototype into a full, player-relative HUD system.

  - Highlight the major architectural shifts, not every single code-level change.

  - Explain why each version exists and when to reference it.

High-Level Evolution Summary

  - v1-v3: Foundation and visual scaffolding.

  - v4: Architecture stabilization pivot (authoritative state + setter update pattern).

  - v5-v6: Feature completeness for score momentum + live objective ownership state.

  - v7: Visual readability and layering polish on top of v6 stability.

Version-by-Version Breakdown

v1 (Gameplay Foundation)

  - What changed:

  - Implemented objective-based team ticket logic (3/2/1 points held => 1s/5s/10s scoring).

  - Added custom scoreboard columns (score, kills, deaths, captures).

  - Added core player event rewards and stat updates.

  - Why it matters:

  - Establishes the match rules and event economy.

  - Defines the baseline data model all later versions depend on.

  - Main strengths:

  - Simple, predictable, easy to validate gameplay behavior.

  - Main limitations:

  - No custom HUD feedback beyond scoreboard.

v2 (First HUD Integration)

  - What changed:

  - Added per-player HUD creation and player-unique widget naming.

  - Added initial score visuals and static bar shells.

  - Why it matters:

  - First step from scoreboard-only feedback to in-match UI feedback.

  - Introduces HUD lifecycle concerns (existing players + late joiners).

  - Main strengths:

  - Keeps gameplay stable while proving HUD bootstrapping works.

  - Main limitations:

  - HUD mostly static; limited runtime visual state changes.

v3 (Objective HUD Layout Scaffolding)

  - What changed:

  - Added objective placeholders and A/B/C label presentation structure.

  - Expanded HUD composition and layering layout.

  - Why it matters:

  - Builds the visual framework needed for later live objective-state logic.

  - Main strengths:

  - Clear objective HUD layout baseline.

  - Main limitations:

  - Objective visuals are mostly structural at this stage, not fully state-driven.

v4 (Stability Pivot / Architecture Upgrade)

  - What changed:

  - Introduced authoritative local score state (`gameState`).

  - Added player HUD map for widget-name-driven setter updates.

  - Gated expensive UI refreshes behind score-change checks.

  - Why it matters:

  - This is the most important architecture shift in the project.

  - Prevents desync/duplication patterns from ad-hoc UI handling.

  - Main strengths:

  - Reliable data flow and cleaner update responsibilities.

  - Main limitations:

  - Score text stable, but visual momentum still limited without dynamic fills.

v5 (Dynamic Momentum Feedback)

  - What changed:

  - Added dynamic friendly/enemy bar fill widgets and resize logic.

  - Tied bar width directly to team score values.

  - Why it matters:

  - Players can read momentum instantly without parsing numbers first.

  - Main strengths:

  - Stronger visual readability for match pacing.

  - Main limitations:

  - Objective ownership indicators still less expressive than full state stacks.

v6 (Feature-Complete Gameplay HUD)

  - What changed:

  - Added live objective ownership state visuals for A/B/C (neutral/friendly/enemy).

  - Added objective visibility controller functions and full per-player perspective mapping.

  - Integrated objective icon refresh into main runtime loop and capture events.

  - Why it matters:

  - First version where scoreboard, bars, and objective ownership feedback all work together.

  - Main strengths:

  - Complete, responsive, player-relative HUD behavior.

  - Main limitations:

  - Visual readability can still vary by map/light layering conditions.

v7 (Readability and Layering Polish)

  - What changed:

  - Iterative tuning of objective plates, inner-box contrast, alpha, and label layering.

  - Added/adjusted front-pass letter rendering and alignment refinements.

  - Preserved v6 gameplay logic while improving visual reliability.

  - Why it matters:

  - Focuses on practical in-match clarity, not new rule complexity.

  - Main strengths:

  - Better legibility and cleaner objective marker presentation.

  - Main limitations:

  - Primarily polish-focused; gameplay architecture remains same as v6.

Cross-Version Architecture Progression

  - Data authority progression:

  - v1-v3: Functional but more direct reads/writes.

  - v4+: Clear single score source (`gameState`) drives HUD + header consistency.

  - HUD update strategy progression:

  - v2-v3: Build-oriented.

  - v4+: Create once, mutate with setters/visibility toggles.

  - Objective visualization progression:

  - v3: placeholders.

  - v6: full live state logic.

  - v7: readability/occlusion polish.

Function Importance Across Versions

  - Most critical long-term functions:

  - OnGameModeStarted(): mode bootstrap and recurring update loop.

  - updateTeamScores(): scoring authority and pacing heart.

  - updateAllHudScores(): core score/bar presentation updater.

  - createHUD(player): one-time widget tree constructor for stable runtime mutation.

  - updateAllObjectiveIcons() + updateSingleObjectiveVisibility(...): objective-state visual correctness.

  - Why these matter:

  - Together, they separate responsibilities cleanly: gameplay state, UI construction, UI mutation, and event-driven synchronization.

Recommended Reference Versions By Goal

  - If you need the simplest gameplay rules baseline:

  - Start with v1.

  - If you need architecture pattern reference for stable HUD updates:

  - Start with v4.

  - If you need full gameplay + objective-state HUD behavior:

  - Start with v6.

  - If you need full behavior plus visual readability polish:

  - Start with v7.

Practical Conclusion

  - v4 is the architectural turning point.

  - v6 is the first truly complete functional target.

  - v7 is the best practical presentation target when visual clarity matters in live play.
