Airsup_v2.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose

  - Keeps v1 scoring/stat behavior and introduces first custom HUD pass.

Major Functions And Why They Are Used

  - OnGameModeStarted()
  Why: Still owns objective + scoreboard setup, but now also initializes HUD for players already in match. This prevents "no HUD until respawn/rejoin" issues.

  - createHUD(player)
  Why: Dedicated HUD constructor for one player. It builds the UI tree once and uses unique widget names per player ID to avoid collisions between players.

  - OnPlayerJoinGame(player)
  Why: Ensures late-join players receive stat initialization and HUD setup immediately, matching existing players.

  - updateTeamScores()
  Why: Unchanged scoring core, retained to preserve stable gameplay while HUD features are introduced incrementally.

  - updatePlayerScoreBoard(player)
  Why: Keeps row stats authoritative as in v1, regardless of new HUD visuals.

Why This Version Matters

  - Introduces the "create once, update later" HUD direction.

  - Adds per-player HUD lifecycle management without destabilizing match scoring.

  - Serves as bridge between scoreboard-only gameplay and fully dynamic HUD versions.
