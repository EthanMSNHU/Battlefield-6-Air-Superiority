Airsup_v3.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose
- Extends v2 HUD by introducing objective visual placeholders.

Main Additions Over v2
- Objective A/B/C plates (solid boxes) added to HUD.
- Objective letters (A/B/C) layered above boxes.
- Preserves gameplay and scoreboard logic from v2.

HUD Notes
- Uses shared constants (Y/size/spacing) to align objective elements.
- Uses depth layering so labels stay visible above plates.

Functions
- createHUD(player): now builds score boxes, static bars, objective boxes, and objective letters.
- All scoring/player event functions remain behaviorally same as v2.
