Airsup_v3.ts Explanation
========================

Purpose

  - Expands v2 HUD with objective plate/label structure (A/B/C placeholders).

Major Functions And Why They Are Used

  - createHUD(player)
  Why: Now does substantial visual composition. It places objective boxes, letter labels, score areas, and supporting layers using shared constants so alignment is consistent.

  - OnGameModeStarted()
  Why: Continues stable game loop while ensuring all active players receive the richer HUD layout at startup.

  - updateTeamScores()
  Why: Remains unchanged by design; scoring stays stable while UI layout complexity increases.

HUD Structure Rationale

  - Objective placeholders are added before ownership-state logic so layout/spacing can be validated independently.

  - Shared spacing/size constants reduce "magic-number drift" across A/B/C elements.

  - Layering (depth order) is introduced so labels remain legible over plates.

Why This Version Matters

  - Creates the objective HUD scaffold required for later live ownership states.

  - Separates visual layout evolution from gameplay rule changes.
